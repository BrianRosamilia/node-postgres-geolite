# node-postgres-geolite [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/postgres-geolite.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/postgres-geolite) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zikeji/node-postgres-geolite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zikeji/node-postgres-geolite)

MaxMind Geolite PostgreSQL importer & interface to provide IPv4 and IPv6 lookups for country, subdivisions, city, timezone, area code, ISP, etc. This module is designed to import the GeoIP2 and Geolite Legacy database CSVs into a PostgreSQL database and query it efficiently and effectively.

#### Apologies

I had originally wanted to return the data similar to the [node-maxmind](https://github.com/runk/node-maxmind) project, thus allowing this module to server as a drop-in replacement. Unfortunately I was unable to figure out how to best map the geoname ID data in the database to allow for geoname_ids on each location type (continent, country, subdivisions, city). If you are able to do this, feel free to fork and submit a PR. Otherwise if you have ideas on doing this feel free to contact me to discuss.

## NOTICE

This module is in pre-pre-pre alpha and is not ready for use!

### TODO

- geolite geoname_id importing
- API for queries

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL >= 9.4

## Install
```
$ npm install --save postgres-geolite
```

## Usage

**TODO**

## API

### `geolite.init(options)`

Checks whether the database in PostgreSQL has been initialized, and validates the schema with the current version of this module. If the database is ready, it returns the geoliteDB object in the promise. Otherwise, it updates the PostgreSQL database using the options provided.

#### Object: `options`

If the options provided don't get properly validated by [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi), then an error is returned and can be caught via the reject promise. Validation schema can be found [here](https://github.com/zikeji/node-postgres-geolite/blob/master/lib/configvalidator/index.js).

```javascript
{
  database: object,
  downloads: object,
}
```

##### Object: `database`

Takes the [configuration object](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/wiki/Connection-Syntax#configuration-object) from [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise) with most of the properties.

##### Object: `downloads`

- **(string)** `location`: relative or absolute path to where the GeoLite databases get downloaded (if `local` is false) and decompressed to.
  - **default**: `'./tmp'`
- **(boolean)** `cleanup`: the location folder above will be created if it doesn't exist, if cleanup is set to true it will delete the location folder once it is no longer necessary.
  - **default**: `false`
- **(boolean)** `local`: if set to true, the resources below are interpreted as filepaths and decompressed to the location specified above.
  - **default**: `false`
- **(object)** `resources`
  - **(string)** `geolite2_city`: direct download link or filepath for the GeoLite2 City database in CSV format, zipped.
    - https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/
  - **(string)** `geolite_asn`: direct download link or filepath for the GeoLite ASN database in CSV / zip format.
  - **(string)** `geolite_asn_ipv6`: direct download link or filepath for the GeoLite ASN database in CSV / zip format.
    - https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/

#### Returns: `Promise (geoliteDB)`

Promise that contains the object used for all future API calls.

### `geoliteDB.update()`

Forces an update on the PostgreSQL database using the options provided in `geolite.init`.

#### Returns: `Promise ()`

Resolves when finished, if any error occurs it rejects.

## Performance

If you clone the repo and run the tests on your target system you should get a good idea of expected performance from the test results.

### Initializing & updating the database

- **System:** Intel Core i5 6600K running Windows 10 with the PostgreSQL DB on a SATA 6Gbps SSD
  - **Result:** (complete imports incomplete, no result available at this time)

Building gets done on secondary tables, and when complete the original table gets dropped and replaced with the new one. This is what I considered the best approach for minimizing potential downtime during an update.

You can also refer to the tests on Travis-CI for performance.

### Queries

Thanks to the built in operator class GiST [inet_ops](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/gist-builtin-opclasses.html), queries take ~30ms on my test system. The test cases ran on Travis-CI can also give you an idea of expected performance on systems with their infrastructure.
